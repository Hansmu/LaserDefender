We have problems with collisions between friendly targets and friendly bullets. In order to avoid that we can add layers.
Add a new layer. After adding it go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics 2D. It allows you to select what collides with what.

In order to handle animations: click on your console, project etc. tab, add Animation. Once you create the animation in that window you get a timeline.
Pressing on the red circle, you go into record mode. Since we chose position as a property to change, then we get points on the timeline referring to positions in time.
Change the specific positions in time to edit the animation for its movement.
You can do all sorts of things in the animator. Scripts, collision etc.
You can use the Animator tab to combine many different animations.
